<!-- Array in Javascript -->

<!-- Assignments on Arrays & Methods -->

<!-- 1. Basic Array Assignments** -->

<!-- 1. Create an array of numbers from 1 to 10. Print all numbers using: -->

   <!-- * `for` loop
   * `for...of` loop
   * `forEach()`
2. Create an array of fruits and print each fruit in **uppercase**.
3. Find the **sum of all numbers** in an array using `forEach()`. -->

---

<!-- ### **2. Assignments using `map()`**

1. Given an array `[2, 4, 6, 8]`, create a new array where each number is **doubled**.
2. Convert an array of names `["suhail", "khan", "rahul"]` into an array of **capitalized names** (`["Suhail", "Khan", "Rahul"]`).
3. Given an array of numbers, return a new array with the **square** of each number.

---

### **3. Assignments using `filter()`**

1. Given an array of numbers `[5, 12, 8, 130, 44]`, filter out numbers **less than 10**.
2. From an array of ages `[12, 17, 18, 24, 30]`, filter only the ages **eligible to vote** (18+).
3. Given an array of words `["pen", "notebook", "pencil", "book"]`, filter words that have **length > 4**.
4. From an array of numbers `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]`, filter only **even numbers**.

---

### **4. Combination of `map()` and `filter()`**

1. From an array `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]` →

   * First filter only **even numbers**
   * Then return their **squares**.
2. Given an array of student objects:

   ```js
   let students = [
     { name: "Suhail", marks: 85 },
     { name: "Rahul", marks: 45 },
     { name: "Aman", marks: 65 }
   ];
   ```

   * Filter students with marks **>= 50**
   * Create a new array of only their **names in uppercase**.
